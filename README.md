**RMI Money Conversion Program**

---

**Overview:**

This is a simple Remote Method Invocation (RMI) program designed to convert currencies using Java. The program consists of two main components: a server and a client. The server handles the currency conversion logic, while the client interacts with the user and communicates with the server to perform the conversion.

**Folder Structure:**

- **Server:** Contains the server-side code responsible for handling currency conversion.
- **Client:** Holds the client-side code that interacts with the user and communicates with the server.



**Note:**

- This program provides a basic demonstration of RMI and currency conversion. It may not cover all currency conversion scenarios and may not reflect real-time exchange rates.
- Modify the code as needed for production use, considering security, error handling, and performance optimizations.
